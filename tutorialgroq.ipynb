      "Bill Gates is an American business magnate, software developer, and philanthropist. He is best known for co-founding Microsoft Corporation, the world's largest software company, with Paul Allen in 1975.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Early Life and Education**\n",
      "\n",
      "William Henry Gates III was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington. His father, William H. Gates Sr., was a successful attorney, and his mother, Mary Maxwell Gates, was a philanthropist and university regent. Gates showed a keen interest in computer programming at a young age and began writing his own code when he was just 13 years old.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gates attended Lakeside School, an exclusive private school in Seattle, where he met his future business partner, Paul Allen. They both shared an interest in computers and formed a partnership that would last a lifetime. Gates scored 1590 out of 1600 on his SAT and was accepted into Harvard University in 1973. However, he dropped out of college two years later to focus on his business venture, Microsoft.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Microsoft and Career**\n",
      "\n",
      "Gates and Allen founded Microsoft (a combination of \"microcomputer\" and \"software\") in 1975. Their first product was a version of the programming language BASIC for the Altair 8800 microcomputer. The company's big break came in 1980 when IBM approached Microsoft to create an operating system for its new personal computer. Gates and his team developed the operating system, which they called MS-DOS, and licensed it to IBM.\n",
      "\n",
      "The success of MS-DOS propelled Microsoft to the top of the burgeoning personal computer industry. Gates became one of the richest people in the world as Microsoft's stock soared. He took the company public in 1986, and by the 1990s, Microsoft had become the dominant player in the software industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Philanthropy**\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 2000s, Gates began to shift his focus from business to philanthropy. He and his wife, Melinda French Gates, established the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000, which focuses on global health, education, and poverty alleviation. The foundation has donated billions of dollars to various causes, including the fight against malaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gates has also been a vocal advocate for climate change action and has invested in various clean energy initiatives. In 2010, he and Warren Buffett founded the Giving Pledge, a campaign that encourages billionaires to donate at least half of their wealth to charity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Personal Life**\n",
      "\n",
      "Gates married Melinda French in 1994, and they have three children together. They announced their divorce in 2021. Gates is known for his love of reading and has a vast collection of rare books. He is also a fan of bridge and has played against some of the world's top players.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Legacy**\n",
      "\n",
      "Bill Gates is widely recognized as one of the most successful entrepreneurs of our time. He has been instrumental in shaping the modern computer industry and has had a profound impact on the way we live and work. Through his philanthropic efforts, he has also made a significant difference in the lives of millions of people around the world.\n"

OCIO and the Department of Management are seeking a Web Content Architect to support approximately 80 Drupal websites migrating to a new code base and design. The Content Architect will be expected to work with agency content managers with Google Analytics data and data from other SEO tools to make recommendations about retiring content, content design, and navigation. The Content Architect will handle requests from across the enterprise to publish new and updated website content and verify, maintain, and update as necessary website calendar entries and notifications. The migration to the new brand has been structured into five phases with this Scope of Work covering execution of Phases One through Three for 76 agency Drupal websites including the integration of Iowa Department of Public Health .Net website. These sites have over 118,000 pages and 41,696 documents. The new Iowa brand design is intended to be a collaborative process incorporating the best design features from recent State website development efforts and other State portals based on Drupal (e.g., Arizona, Georgia, Massachusetts, and North Carolina). The goal of the project is to provide human centered design resulting in a portal experience that is designed around “life events” rather than the state agencies’ organizational structures. Constituents should be able to access services through a single web portal. Duties: • Ability to create and publish website content using common Content Management Systems. • Identify keywords and implement keyword placement and SEO best practices. • Ability to use SEO tools to identify content to be improved. • Ability to capture and convey the interrelationship of program information (and large concepts in general). • Ability to edit content to plain language, an 8th grade reading level, and for use in a chatbot. • Ability to write content for chat • Ability to produce Google Analytics Reports • Ability to setup Google Tag Manager • Ability to work in Google Search Console to submit sitemaps and remove pages from indexing where 404 errors occur.
